## Introduction
This suite of components provides custom, resuable Blazor components. These components are easy to use right out of the box, so developers can focus on building their applications. To keep the libraries small and independent, we have a project and NuGet package for each component, so that developers can just include what they need.

Supported components: Spinner.
Future components: ImageSpinner, Timer.

## Installation
These libraries are in NuGet packages so they are easy to add to your project. To install these packages into your solution, you can use the Package Manager. In PM, please use the following commands:
